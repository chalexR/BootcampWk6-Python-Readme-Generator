# Bootcamp Wk6 - Readme File Generator in Python 
 
This project is my first Python script written entirely from scratch, built as part of my learning journey into Python programming. The main goal was not to create a polished tool, but to understand the core concepts of Python, such as functions, classes, and user input handling, while exploring libraries like InquirerPy and Rich.

I built this while on holiday, so time was limited and I was not able to finish it to the standard I had hoped. However, I am really happy with the bare-bones version—it functions well enough for my current needs and represents a solid foundation for a beginner-level script.

Over the next few weeks, I plan to expand the content generation system further, particularly to better support multiple languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python) in GitHub README files.# Installation Instructions 

### Clone the repository

To get a local copy of this project up and running, clone the repository using:

```git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git```

### Navigate into the project directory

Then navigate into the project directory:

```cd your-repo-name```

### Install Dependencies

## Python (with pip)If you’re using Python, make sure your virtual environment is activated, then run:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To create and activate one:## macOS / Linux```python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate```## Windows```python -m venv venv
venv\Scriptsctivate```Once activated, your terminal prompt should change (e.g., (venv)), and you can proceed to install dependencies.

### Start the Python Application

After activating your virtual environment and installing dependencies, you can run the application with:```python main.py```* *Replace main.py with your actual entry-point file name if different.* *If your project requires environment variables or setup steps before running, make sure those are completed first.

['Run the main script and instructions will guide you through multiple questions to build you a new README.md file for any projects', '', 'Make sure to add as much information as possible!', '```python main.py```']# Installation Instructions
